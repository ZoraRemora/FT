  <p>
    A scarred landscape<br>
    Blood rivers mar the butcher-knifed and sick soil<br>
    Gore Mountains of entrail saints scale the suffering horizon<br>
    Derelict and frozen in a state of hateful mourning<br><br>

    The trudging legs of long forgotten scale-skinned martyrs merged with the webbed skingrafts of groundswells : abomination rites' artificial makings<br><br>

    Fulfilling tasks beyond critical thought<br>
    For the purpose of the air and the wind<br>
    The black bosom of fine crafted suffering<br>
    A hopeful tales course : scoliosis' slave<br><br>

    Exponential entropy, and the sinew yet grows towerlike<br>
    Deep Screams of envy<br>
    YES!<br>
    They yearn for this : stricken by storms aching in sky and all the places beyond the pines <br>
    YES!<br>
    Picked Scabs dried upon burned skin<br>
    YES!<br><br>

    It is bliss.<br><br>

    Crystal, crystal, is my song<br>
    It lays itself upon the beast<br>
    And my compassion for righteous murder knows no bounds<br>
    The endless hell which awaits you in my dreams
